                                <p class="desc">Rajkot is relatively a young kingdom, carved out of territories seeded and captured by Thakore Sahib Vibhoji Ajoji Jadeja, a scion of the Jamnagar Royal Family in 1620 AD. The city got its name in the memory of its co-founder Raju Sandhi. In the 1720 AD, Rajkot was seized by Masum Khan, an official ruler of the Junagadh region. During the rule of the Masum Khan, the city was fortified with an 8 feet thick wall and eight gates, which were all adorned with iron spikes. In the year 1807, Rajkot became a British province. It was during the British rule; Rajkot saw a development in the field of art, culture and education. The city is the birthplace of the finest intellectuals who ultimately led India in the freedom struggle.</p>
