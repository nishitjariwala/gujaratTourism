                            <div class="description">
                                <p class="desc">Vadodara (formerly Baroda) is the third largest city in Gujarat, located on the bank of Vishwamitri River, towards the south-east of Ahmedabad. Gigantic monuments, museums and gardens documenting the Indian history dominate the old quarter of Vadodara. The tinsel town is the brainchild of Sayajirao III, a farsighted ruler who introduced free primary education and laid foundation for premier institutions like Bank of Baroda, a railway system and Maharaja Sayajirao University.</p>
                                <p class="desc">Many tales and fables are associated with the name of the city. As per the history accounts, the city was christened as 'Chandravati' after its ruler Raja Chandan, later it was changed to 'Viravati 'meaning the abode of the brave, and then 'Vadpatra' due to the abundance of banyan trees here. From the term 'Vadpatra', the city got its final name - Baroda or Vadodara.</p>
                                <p class="desc">According to historians, Vadodara's history is over 2,000 years old. The first native people of Vadodara were some Hindu king, who ruled the town till 1297. People of Gupta Empire than start exploring the region and became the first ruler of Vadodara in the early year of the Christian era. After fierce battles, Vadodara was seized by Solanki dynasty. Years later, the city was vanquished by Mughals, which were later overthrown by Gaekwad ruler. Vadodara was the stage where events big and activities have unfolded.</p>
                                <p class="desc">Vadodara owes much of its splendours to the Sayajirao Gaekwad III, a formal ruler of the city. He was a great modernizer who laid the foundations of Vadodara’s modern reputation as Gujarat’s cultural capital. Today, Vadodara is known to the world as a heady mix of breathtaking art, interesting sights and vibrant street life. The Laxmi Vilas Palace, partially converted into a museum, is the finest example of the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. Designed by Major Charles Mant in the year 1880, the palace is the major tourist attraction of Vadodara region. Few kilometres away from the Laxmi Vilas Palace is the Maharaja Fateh Singh Museum, which is famed for its unique collection of painting by the famous artist Raja Ravi Verma.</p>
