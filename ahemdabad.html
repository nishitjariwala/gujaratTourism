                            <div class="description">
                                <p class="desc">A rapidly growing metropolis, an industrial hub, an educational hotspot, and a city with a magnificent past – Ahmedabad is one of the most important cities in Gujarat and is fast becoming a very popular tourist destination as well. Home to a plethora of remarkable temples, intriguing museums, serene lakes, good restaurants, and classy market, with a little bit of colonial history attached to it, Ahmedabad is a great example of how a city can still retain every bit of its old-world charm while still rapidly progressing on the path of globalization and commercialization. Located on the banks of the Sabarmati river, Ahmedabad is the former capital of Gujarat, and its delicious food, colourful culture and amazing hospitality attract a huge number of tourists all year round.</p>
                                <p class="desc">Nothing portrays the extreme down-to-earth lifestyle of Ahmedabad’s citizens better than the Sabarmati Ashram. Situated directly beside the Sabarmati river, this quaint and peaceful ashram was built by Mahatma Gandhi after he returned from South Africa. To this date, Gandhiji’s living quarters are preserved here and is now used as a museum where visitors can learn all about his life and his teachings. The infamous Dandi Salt March, which was a key point in India’s independence struggle, originated from this ashram. It is the most significant place of tourist interest in Ahmedabad, and a huge number of Indian, as well as international tourists, visit this place all year round to visit this ashram which holds a very important place in India’s history.</p>

                                <p class="desc">Unbeknownst to many, Ahmedabad is home to the Jama Masjid, which was built during the era of the Delhi Sultanate, and is as majestic and spectacular as its namesake in Delhi. The structure is made entirely out of yellow sandstone, and its architecture depicts a beautiful amalgamation of Islamic and Hindu styles.</p>
